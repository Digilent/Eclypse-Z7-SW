* @note The same buffer can be reused, however if either the size or address is changed, new block descriptors need to be allocated.
*       Approximately 16 * BufferLength * sizeof(u32) / MaxBurstLengthBytes words are allocated, with additional padding space to ensure that
*       the block descriptor alignment requirement is satisfied.
*       Blocks are used to describe a single burst, and their length is set to the max burst size of the AXI DMA. This is not an inherent
*       requirement imposed by the AXI DMA, and theoretically any block size could be used. However, some minimum burst size exists such that
*       AXI4-full protocol overhead significantly affects the bandwidth of the transfer. It may be possible to use short bursts as long as the
*       following burst is long enough for the scatter gather interface to keep up.
*       FIXME: It may be possible to use only a single block descriptor with cyclic mode. It should be determined whether the DMA engine will
*              repeatedly fetch the same block.
*		FIXME: The minimum block size that can be consistently supported should be experimentally determined.
*		FIXME: Currently, the DMA core must be reset in order to cancel any blocks still pending after the final block in an arbitrarily-long
*		       transfer has been received. These blocks must be submitted to hardware in order since it is unknown while the final block is in flight
*		       whether it is actually final or not, it is unknown whether the next acquisition will reuse the same buffer, and the blocks must be
*		       available to hardware to prefetch before the block before them is complete.
*		FIXME: At time of writing, buffer length is restricted to values of N * MaxBurstLengthBytes, where N is an integer and MaxBurstLengthBytes
*		       is 256x64/8=1024 bytes (BurstSize x DataWidth bits). Whether BufferLength meets this requirement is not checked within this function.
*		       If buffer length doesn't meet this requirement, S2mmFindStartOfBuffer may not return the correct address in some edge cases.
*		FIXME: It should be explored whether multiple buffers can easily be attached and switched out (perhaps by taking advantage of multiple Rx rings)
*			   in order to allow an acquisition to occur at the same time as a previous acquisition is being transferred to the host.
*		FIXME: Errors should be returned in several bad-status cases (eg if malloc or some XAxiDma API call fail).
